> Restore Glaciered S3 Data

I can't tell you how many times I've had to restore data from improperly configured S3 buckets.

This is a simple script that will restore all the data in a bucket that has been glaciered [within 3-5 hours](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/storage-classes/glacier/) using [rclone](https://github.com/rclone/rclone).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -eo pipefail

BUCKET="s3://my-bucket"

rclone backend restore \
    -o priority=Standard \
    -o lifetime=90 \
    $BUCKET 2>> error.log | tee -a run.log
```
