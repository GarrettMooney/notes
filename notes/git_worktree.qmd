> Git worktree for quickly switching between branches

Do i already have any worktrees?

```bash
git worktree list
```

Create new worktree where:

* the path for the worktree is `.worktree/hotfix`
* the commit/branch to use in worktree is `main`

::: {.callout-warning}

Now you can't checkout another branch in your parent repo until you remove this worktree

:::

```bash
git worktree add .worktree/hotfix main
```

Enter worktree:

```bash
cd .worktree/hotfix
```

Make changes:

```bash
git add ...
git commit ...
git push ...
```

Remove worktree:

```bash
cd ../..
git worktree remove hotfix
```
