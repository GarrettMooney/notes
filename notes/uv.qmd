> Using the uv package manager

[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is the fastest, ergonomic package manager for Python that I use these days.
It is written in rust (btw) and is a drop-in replacement for `pip` and `virtualenv` as of mid-2024,
but I suspect that there are a lot of potential announcements around `uv` integrations happening shortly.

Here is how I've been using it for experiments:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

if ! command -v uv &> /dev/null; then
    echo "===> Installing uv"
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
fi

echo "===> Creating venv"
uv venv .bayes

echo "==> Activating venv"
source .bayes/bin/activate

echo "==> Installing packages"
uv pip install ipykernel jupyterlab
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

echo "==> Creating jupyter kernel"
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=.bayes --display-name="Python 3.12 (.bayes)"
```
